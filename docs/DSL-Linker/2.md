# Location (Loc) Component

## Overview

The `Loc` component is responsible for tracking source code locations in the DSL. It provides a unified way to represent and compare source code positions, which is essential for error reporting and debugging.

## Core Components

### Location Types

The `Loc` trait defines three main implementations:

  1. **KnownLoc** - Represents a specific location in source code
  2. **UnknownLoc** - Represents an unknown location
  3. **NoLoc** - Represents a non-existent location (used for synthetic nodes)

### Core Implementation

```scala
sealed trait Loc extends Ordered[Loc] {
  def location: String
  def near: String
  def file: String
}
```

## Location Types in Detail

### KnownLoc

Represents a specific location in source code with file, line, and column information:

```scala
final class KnownLoc(
  val file: String, 
  val line: Int, 
  val column: Int, 
  val unformattedNear: String
) extends Loc {
  def location = s"$file:$line:$column"
  override def near: String = unformattedNear.trim
}
```

Key features:

  - Tracks exact file, line, and column information
  - Provides formatted location string
  - Includes source code context ("near" text)
  - Implements proper comparison and equality

### UnknownLoc

Represents a location that cannot be determined:

```scala
case object UnknownLoc extends Loc {
  override def file: String = ""
  override def location: String = "Unknown"
  override def near: String = "Unknown"
}
```

Key features:

  - Used when source location cannot be determined
  - Implements special equality rules
  - Provides fallback location information

### NoLoc

Represents a synthetic or non-existent location:

```scala
case object NoLoc extends Loc {
  override def file: String = ""
  override def location: String = "Nothing"
  override def near: String = "Nothing"
}
```

Key features:

  - Used for synthetic nodes or generated code
  - Implements special equality rules
  - Provides minimal location information

## Factory Methods

The `Loc` object provides factory methods for creating locations:

```scala
object Loc {
  def apply(file: String, position: Position, fullNear: Boolean): Loc = 
    position match {
      case o: OffsetPosition =>
        new KnownLoc(
          file,
          position.line,
          if (position.line > 0) position.column else 0,
          if (fullNear) o.source.toString else if (position.line > 0) o.lineContents else ""
        )
      case _ => UnknownLoc
    }

  def apply(file: String, line: Int, column: Int, near: String) = 
    new KnownLoc(file, line, column, near)
}
```

## Location Comparison

The `Loc` trait implements `Ordered[Loc]` to provide consistent ordering:

```scala
override def compare(that: Loc): Int =
  if ((that eq UnknownLoc) || (that eq NoLoc)) -1
  else {
    val t = that.asInstanceOf[KnownLoc]
    val i0 = file.compare(t.file)
    if (i0 == 0) {
      val i1 = line.compare(t.line)
      if (i1 == 0) column.compare(t.column)
      else i1
    } else i0
  }
```

Ordering rules:

  1. UnknownLoc and NoLoc are considered equal
  2. KnownLoc instances are ordered by:
    - File name
    - Line number
    - Column number

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Creating a Location from Parser Position

```scala
val loc = Loc("MyFile.scala", parserPosition, fullNear = true)
```

### 2. Creating a Location with Specific Coordinates

```scala
val loc = Loc("MyFile.scala", line = 42, column = 10, near = "def example()")
```

### 3. Error Reporting

```scala
def reportError(loc: Loc, message: String): Unit = {
  println(s"${loc.location}: $message")
  println(s"Near: ${loc.near}")
}
```

## Important Notes

  1. **Location Equality**
    - UnknownLoc equals any other location
    - NoLoc equals UnknownLoc or NoLoc
    - KnownLoc instances are equal if they have the same file, line, and column

  2. **Source Context**
    - The "near" text provides context around the location
    - Can be full source or just the line contents
    - Useful for error messages and debugging

  3. **Location Ordering**
    - Provides consistent ordering for error reporting
    - Helps in organizing and displaying multiple errors
    - Maintains natural source code order

## Best Practices

  1. Always provide location information when possible
  2. Use appropriate location type for the context
  3. Include meaningful "near" text for better error messages
  4. Handle unknown locations gracefully
  5. Consider location ordering in error reporting

## Common Pitfalls

  1. Not providing enough context in "near" text
  2. Ignoring location information in error handling
  3. Incorrect handling of UnknownLoc and NoLoc
  4. Not considering location ordering in error reports
  5. Missing file information in location objects
